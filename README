The Linked Data Platform is a toolkit for generating RDF from spreadsheets,  then importing that data into Drupal, where it can be visualised and re-published. This distribution currently contains everything you need to pull RDF data into Drupal, relying on modules such as sparql_views and rdf_importer to generate views and nodes driven by RDF.

While Drupal is used for the visualisation and publishing, we rely on additional software such as XLWrap to generate RDF from spreadsheets, and Virtuoso to serve as a triple store . The tools and techniques that are used for these steps will be documented on the LDP github wiki, but we plan to release a VM / Amazon AMI that will contain everything you need for the entire process.
